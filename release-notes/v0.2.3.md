manubot version 0.2.3 release notes
===================================

Manubot version 0.2.3 contains various enhancements.
In addition, the source code location has moved from <https://github.com/greenelab/manubot> to <https://github.com/manubot/manubot> (see [GH94](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/94)).

New features
------------

Citations of shortDOIs are now supported (see [GH92](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/92) and [GH93](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/93)).
[shortDOIs](http://shortdoi.org/), which start with `10/` rather than `10.`, can now be cited just like a DOI. For example, `@doi:10/gddkhn` is a supported citation.
Manubot expands shortDOI citations to their regular DOIs, e.g. `@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387`, such that `manubot process` will treat both the short and regular form as the same citation.

Bug fixes
---------

Queries to Manubot's tanslation-server now specify `single=1` to enforce returning a single record per persistent identifier (see [GH90](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/90)).
Previously, multiple results were [sometimes](https://github.com/zotero/translation-server/issues/65) returned, causing Manubot's JSON CSL retrieval to fail.
Furthermore, Zotero child notes now ignored, fixing another [failure mode](https://github.com/zotero/translation-server/issues/67) for CSL export of Zotero metadata.

Null authors are now allowed in `metadata.yaml` and do not crash Manubot with a TypeError (see [GH91](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/91)).

The codebase has been updated to avoid deprecation warnings in Pandas v0.24 (see [GH95](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/95)).
