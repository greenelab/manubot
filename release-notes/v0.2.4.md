manubot version 0.2.4 release notes
===================================

Manubot version 0.2.4 contains various enhancements and improvements to the citation processing workflow.

New features
------------

Create the new `manubot.pandoc` submodule with code for interacting with the system Pandoc installation (see [GH103](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/103)).
This module creates an organized location for Pandoc-related code, which will help with development of creating a Pandoc filter for citation-by-identifier (see [GH99](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/99)).

Manual references can now be supplied in formats other than CSL JSON.
Formats supported by `pandoc-citeproc --bib2json` can now be supplied to `manubot process`. See [GH100](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/100) and [GH104](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/104).

Changes
-------

Additional refactoring of the `manubot.cite` submodule has moved the package closer to a well-defining processing pipeline for citations ([GH114](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/114) and [GH113](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/113)).
The column names in to `citations.tsv` changed to [`manuscript_id`, `detagged_id`, `standard_id`, `short_id`].

Make any missing parent directories for the `--output-directory` and `--cache-directory` arguments of `manubot process`.
See [GH115](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/115) and [GH102](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/102).

Read text files using the `utf-8-sig` encoding (to strip BOMs if present).
Write text files using `utf-8` encoding.
UTF-8 ensures compatibility with Pandoc, which uses it for IO.
Also keeps operation consistent across files / platforms.
See [GH125](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/issues/125) and [GH127](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/127).

The README has been updated with improved installation instructions and the Manubot software paper citation.
See [GH118](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/118) and [GH121](https://github.com/manubot/manubot/pull/121).
