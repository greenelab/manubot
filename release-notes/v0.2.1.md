manubot version 0.2.1 release notes
===================================

Manubot version 0.2.1 contains several improvements to the package's citation infrastructure.

New features
------------

Support has been added for raw citations for references without supported persistent identifiers (see [GH62](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/issues/62) and [GH74](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/pull/74)).
Raw citations require the user to manually specify the CSL JSON.

Error messages for invalid citations have been improved (see [GH76](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/pull/76) and [GH71](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/issues/71)).
More types of incorrect citations are now caught internally before any external APIs are queried for metadata.

The `manubot cite` command has been updated to generate metadata for all valid, while logging error messages for invalid citations (see [GH77](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/pull/77)).
Previously, a single invalid citation would cause the program to exit before outputting references for valid citations.

Bug fixes
---------

Previously, metadata for `pmcid` citations was retrieved from the NCBI Citation Exporter.
This service was [taken offline](https://twitter.com/dhimmel/status/1061787168820092929) without notice causing citation retrieval to fail.
NCBI replaced the previous service with the [Literature Citation Exporter](https://api.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/lit/ctxp).
The `manubot.cite.pubmed.get_pmc_citeproc` function has been changed to use the new service (see [GH80](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/pull/80)).

Previously, CSL JSON Items were being generated with empty `date-parts` arrays, which would cause pandoc-citeproc to fail.
Manubot's CSL JSON pruning infrastructure has been updated to delete empty `date-parts` arrays (see [GH66](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/issues/66) and [GH65](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/pull/65)).

Entrez E-Utils returned integer-encoded months for certain `pmid` citations causing `citeproc_from_pubmed_article` to fail.
Both integer and character month encodings are now supported (see [GH72](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot/pull/72)).
