## Introduction

The website Sci-Hub, now in its fifth year of existence, provides gratis access to scholarly literature, despite the continued presence of paywalls.
Sci-Hub brands itself as "the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers."
The website, started in 2011, is run by Alexandra Elbakyan, a graduate student and native of Kazakhstan who now resides in Russia [@doi:10.1126/science.aaf5675; @doi:10.1038/nature.2015.18876].
Elbakyan describes herself as motivated to provide universal access to knowledge [@url:https://engineuring.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/sci-hub-is-a-goal-changing-the-system-is-a-method/; @url:https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/4355308/50/elsevier-inc-v-sci-hub/; @url:http://www.leafscience.org/alexandra-elbakyan/].

Cite the same paper in three ways [@pmid:25648772; @pmcid:PMC4304851; @doi:10.7717/peerj.705].
Here's a citation of the same paper using its shortDOI [@doi:10/98p], which should be grouped with the other DOI reference.

Cite using a `raw` citation @raw:model-free-data.
Let's cite the same citation but using a `tag`, i.e. @tag:model-free-data.
