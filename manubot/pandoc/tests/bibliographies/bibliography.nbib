TI  - Sci-Hub provides access to nearly all scholarly literature.

AB  - The website Sci-Hub enables users to download PDF versions of scholarly articles,
      including many articles that are paywalled at their journal's site. Sci-Hub has
      grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been
      unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub's database contains 68.9%
      of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of
      articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by
      discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular,
      paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides
      greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university
      in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit
      services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at
      <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
      xlink:href="https://greenelab.github.io/scihub">https://greenelab.github.io/scihu
      b</ext-link> allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first
      time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an
      Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become
      unsustainable.

TI  - Reproducibility of computational workflows is automated using continuous
      analysis.
PG  - 342-346

AB  - Replication, validation and extension of experiments are crucial for scientific
      progress. Computational experiments are scriptable and should be easy to
      reproduce. However, computational analyses are designed and run in a specific
      computing environment, which may be difficult or impossible to match using
      written instructions. We report the development of continuous analysis, a
      workflow that enables reproducible computational analyses. Continuous analysis
      combines Docker, a container technology akin to virtual machines, with continuous
      integration, a software development technique, to automatically rerun a
      computational analysis whenever updates or improvements are made to source code
      or data. This enables researchers to reproduce results without contacting the
      study authors. Continuous analysis allows reviewers, editors or readers to verify
      reproducibility without manually downloading and rerunning code and can provide
      an audit trail for analyses of data that cannot be shared.
