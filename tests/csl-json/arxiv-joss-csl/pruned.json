    "abstract": "This article describes the motivation, design, and progress of the Journal of\nOpen Source Software (JOSS). JOSS is a free and open-access journal that\npublishes articles describing research software. It has the dual goals of\nimproving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for\nresearch software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within\nthe current merit system of science, JOSS addresses the dearth of rewards for\nkey contributions to science made in the form of software. JOSS publishes\narticles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its\nrigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality,\ndocumentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A JOSS article\ncontains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software,\nreferences, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point\nof a JOSS submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts.\nSubmission and review proceed in the open, on GitHub. Editors, reviewers, and\nauthors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, JOSS does not\nreject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles\nremain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or\nwithdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, JOSS\ngives it a DOI, deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin\ncollecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services.\nAuthors retain copyright of their JOSS article, releasing it under a Creative\nCommons Attribution 4.0 International License. In its first year, starting in\nMay 2016, JOSS published 111 articles, with more than 40 additional articles\nunder review. JOSS is a sponsored project of the nonprofit organization\nNumFOCUS and is an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative.",
